When you’re unsure about which variables to use in the stimulus of your testbench, a helpful approach is to check the top-level entity of your design. Look for input and output signals like SW, HEX, KEY, or any other variable names in that entity, as these typically represent the inputs and outputs managed by the testbench. The inputs are the signals that the stimulus will set values for, simulating real inputs during testing.

When connecting the USB cable to the board, make sure to insert it into the left port at the top, where it says "USB Blaster." This port is specifically for programming and debugging, and the name labeled on it confirms its purpose. Using the correct port is essential for your connection to function properly.

If you ever need to identify the model of the board and don’t have the manual nearby, simply look at the CPU area on the board itself. The model name is usually printed there, allowing you to confirm the board model easily.
